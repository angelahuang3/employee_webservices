# Employee Web Services Demo
This demo, part of my internship at Shin Kong Life Insurance, focuses on acquainting myself with **Spring MVC** for **Full-Stack Web Development** and mastering **CRUD** operations utilizing an **Oracle database**.

Exploring the code offers deeper insights into the management of employee data within the enterprise systems.
